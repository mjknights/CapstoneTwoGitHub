    "Household electricity usage is dependent on various factors such as household occupancy, location, and structural features. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administation (EIA), 52% of household energy consumption is used for space heating and air conditioning. Heating and air conditioning usage vary significantly based on location, home size and structure, and equpment and fuels used. 25% of household energy usage consists of water heating, lighting, and refrigeration (i.e. year round energy use). The remaining 23% consists of devices such as televisions, cooking appliances, washer and dryers, and consumer electronics (i.e. computers, smart phones, video game consoles, streaming devices, etc.). The purpose of this project is to develope a predictive model which estimates household electricity usage based on factors such as household occupancy, location, and structural features. "
